## Risk Management and Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Legacy Data Migration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Complex data formats or corrupted legacy files
   - **Mitigation**: Early analysis of sample data, robust error handling
   - **Contingency**: Manual data entry tools as backup

2. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - **Risk**: Slow performance with 50K+ voucher entries
   - **Mitigation**: Early performance testing, database optimization
   - **Contingency**: Data archiving and paging strategies

3. **Hotkey System Compatibility**
   - **Risk**: Conflicts with system hotkeys or accessibility tools
   - **Mitigation**: Configurable hotkey system, extensive testing
   - **Contingency**: Mouse-based alternatives for all functions

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Third-party Library Dependencies**
   - **Risk**: Breaking changes or licensing issues
   - **Mitigation**: Pin specific versions, evaluate alternatives
   - **Contingency**: Built-in alternatives for critical functionality

2. **SQLite Concurrency Issues**
   - **Risk**: Database locks or corruption under heavy use
   - **Mitigation**: WAL mode, proper connection management
   - **Contingency**: SQL Server LocalDB migration path

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Data layer and business logic (70% coverage minimum)
- **Integration Tests**: Database operations and file I/O
- **UI Tests**: Critical user workflows and hotkey combinations
- **Performance Tests**: Large dataset operations and memory usage
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Side-by-side comparison with legacy system

### Code Quality Standards
- **Code Reviews**: All commits reviewed before merge
- **Static Analysis**: Use built-in .NET analyzers
- **Documentation**: All public APIs documented
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and audit

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Configuration
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows</TargetFramework>
